**Audit Report: Black Screen and Rendering Failure on Cloud Run**

---

## 📌 Project Context

This audit was conducted on the application **"JAVA GENESIS AI: The Era of Augmented Development"**, deployed via **Google Cloud Run**. The application consists of 8 informational pages focused on Generative AI and its impact on the Java ecosystem. The frontend is built with **React + Tailwind + Vite**, and served using **Nginx** in a multi-stage Docker container.

## 🔍 Summary of Findings

### 🔴 Critical Issues

#### 1. `index.html` used `importmap` with external CDN URLs
- **Problem:**  
  The application was configured to load React and other dependencies from external CDNs (`aistudiocdn.com`) via an `importmap`. This conflicted with the bundled assets generated by Vite during the build process, resulting in a mixed dependency state and rendering failure.
- **Resolution:**  
  The `importmap` block was removed from `index.html`. The application now correctly uses the locally bundled dependencies.

#### 2. `Dockerfile` did not copy the `dist` directory
- **Problem:**  
  The final Nginx container lacked the built application files because the `COPY` command was missing. This caused Nginx to serve an empty directory, resulting in a blank screen.
- **Resolution:**  
  The following line was added to the Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
## 🟡 Moderate Issues
Inline styles and scripts in index.html
Problem: The HTML file contained inline <style> and <script> blocks. While functional, this reduces maintainability and caching efficiency.

Recommendation: Move styles to index.css and script logic into React components.

## ✅ Verified Components
nginx.conf: Correctly configured to listen on port 8080 and serve static files.

index.css: Tailwind directives are correctly defined.

index.tsx: React mounts successfully to the #root element.

App.tsx: Component returns visible content when simplified.

## 🚧 Current Status
The application has been updated and redeployed.

The black screen persists: styles and content across all 8 pages are not rendering.

The root cause may extend beyond the previously identified issues.

## 🛠️ Next Steps
Validate that index.css is imported in index.tsx.

Ensure Tailwind is correctly processed by PostCSS during build.

Confirm that all page components are being rendered and routed correctly.

Inspect the final contents of /usr/share/nginx/html inside the container.

Test locally with docker run -p 8080:8080 and inspect the browser console.

## 📁 Repository Status
All critical fixes have been committed and pushed.

App.tsx has been reverted to its original state.

The working tree is clean and ready for further development.

## 🧠 Conclusion
The audit successfully identified and resolved two major deployment issues. However, the application still fails to render content and styles. Further investigation is required to ensure that the build output is complete and that all pages are properly loaded.
